# Week 2 Challenge: Student Portfolio
## Description
The purpose of this project is to make a student portfolio page for myself with original code, to be viewed by a potential employer.
## Acceptance Criteria Met:
* page displays my name, photo, links to page sections, links to my work and contact information (used placeholders for privacy for now).
* when clicking on the navigation in the header, screen will scroll to that section.
* when clicking on the Projects link in the navigation, screen will scroll to section with my work, with images and links to the two projects I've done with live pages so far in the bootcamp.
* the first project I did was the bootcamp prework, and it's linked via the largest image.
* when a user clicks on the first two Project section photos, they are redirected to those projects deployed applications.  The second two photos just link to the photos themselves as they don't have projects to link to yet.
* when you resize the viewport of the portfolio page, the repsonsive layout adjusts to the screen size.
